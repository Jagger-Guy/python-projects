# python-projects

my completed python projects using tkinter
a.py will not work normally. you must go into terminal and type `pip install customtkinter`.

cube.py is a simple collision test i made. if i was bothered, i could make a maze game, but it's too tedious as i have to make each collision for each side of a wall manually. and yes, i am aware of the existence of pygame.

test4.py is a gravity simulation i made. for some reason, after running the program for some time (usually around 20 seconds but sometimes shorter or longer), a tkinter exception will be called and the program will stop functioning. if this is the case you will have to close the program using task manager. but the program DOES work, you will see that it does. maybe it it just a limitation of tkinter, i don't know.
